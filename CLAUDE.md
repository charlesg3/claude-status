# claude-status

AI coding guide for the claude-status project.

## Project Overview

claude-status is a Claude Code hook dispatcher, status bar formatter, and Neovim plugin.
It connects Claude's hook events to OS notifications,
sounds, and the Neovim RPC server so the user always knows what Claude is doing, even
when they've switched away from its window.

## Repository Structure

| Path | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `hooks/claude-hook.sh` | Single dispatcher for all Claude hook events; chainable |
| `scripts/statusline.sh` | Reads state file; outputs formatted status string |
| `scripts/lib/config.sh` | Loads and merges global + user config.json |
| `config.json` | Global defaults (version-controlled) |
| `lua/claude-status/init.lua` | Neovim plugin — session/buffer mapping, claude mode |
| `plugin/claude-status.vim` | Neovim plugin entry point (autoloads init.lua) |
| `install.sh` | OS dependency detection and setup |
| `tests/test-statusline.sh` | Unit tests for status bar output |
| `tests/mock-event.sh` | Fire synthetic hook events for manual testing |
| `tests/test-vim.lua` | Headless Neovim tests for the Lua plugin |
| `CHANGELOG.md` | Keepachangelog format; updated on every PR merge |
| `CLAUDE.md` | This file |

## Development Setup

This plugin lives at `nvim/bundle/claude-status/` inside the dotfiles nvim submodule.
During active development it is NOT treated as a git submodule — it is a plain git repo
checked out directly. `update.sh` skips it. Once development churn settles, it will be
added as a proper submodule.

```sh
cd ~/.config/nvim/bundle/claude-status   # or wherever you checked it out
bash install.sh                           # install OS deps
```

## Branch & PR Naming

- Feature branches:  `feat/issue#-short-kebab-desc`  (e.g. `feat/3-hook-dispatcher`)
- Bug branches:      `bug/issue#-short-kebab-desc`   (e.g. `bug/7-state-file-race`)
- Chore branches:    `chore/issue#-short-kebab-desc` (e.g. `chore/9-lint-scripts`)
- Every branch must have an issue number — create one with `/add-issue` if needed.
- PRs must reference the issue they close: **"Closes #N"** in the PR body.

## Versioning

This project uses **continuous patch/minor releases** — every merged PR produces a new
version tag.

- By default, merging a PR bumps the **patch** version (e.g. `0.1.0` → `0.1.1`).
- If the PR is labelled **`minor`**, the **minor** version is bumped and patch resets to
  zero (e.g. `0.1.3` → `0.2.0`).
- Major version bumps are manual.
- Update `CHANGELOG.md` before merging: add an entry under `[Unreleased]` with the
  correct version heading and date. Use the `/changelog` skill to draft it.

## Commit Style

Format: `[{feat|bug|chore}/KEBAB-DESCRIPTION] short imperative summary`

```
[feat/hook-dispatcher] add single entry-point hook dispatcher

Overview of what is changing and why, with context for the reader.

Changes:
- hooks/claude-hook.sh: new dispatcher reads hook_event_name from stdin
- scripts/common.sh: source shared helpers

Caveats:
- depends on watcher (#2) for full lifecycle management

closes #1
```

- No "Co-Authored-By: Claude" lines
- First line ≤ 72 characters; imperative mood, present tense
- Body: overview paragraph + bulleted change list + caveats if relevant
- Always include `refs #N` or `closes #N` — warn if missing
- One logical change per commit

## README Guidelines

Features in `README.md` should describe what the user **experiences**, not how the
system works internally. Avoid mentioning implementation details (polling intervals,
process management, config merge strategy, script names, etc.) in the Features section.
When adding or changing a feature, update the relevant README section to reflect the
user-visible change — but keep descriptions high-level and benefit-focused.

## Notification Philosophy

Notifications should be **rare, high-signal, and non-intrusive**. The goal is to
surface moments when Claude needs your attention — not to narrate every tool call.

There are exactly two notification events:

- **`long_running`** — fired when a prompt **completes** after running longer than the
  effective threshold. The threshold is resolved per-channel: use the channel's
  `long_running_threshold` if set, otherwise fall back to `long_running.threshold_seconds`
  (global default: 120 s). Setting any threshold to `0` fires on every completion for
  that channel. This lets vim notifications fire sooner than OS notifications.
- **`error`** — fired when a tool call exits non-zero and Claude reports it.

Do not add notifications for routine events (every tool use, every file read, status
updates, etc.). If a new event is proposed, ask: "would this become noise within a day
of normal use?" If yes, it should not be a default-on notification.

## Dependencies

When adding a new OS-level dependency:
1. Add a check block (and an install branch) for it in `install.sh`'s `check_deps()`.
2. Add a row to the requirements table in `README.md`.

Neovim plugin dependencies (airline, lualine, nvim-notify, etc.) are **not managed by
`install.sh`** and must never be added to it. Users install these via their own plugin
manager. Document optional integrations in the section below.

## Optional Neovim Integrations

Planned integrations with common Neovim plugins. All are opt-in; the plugin works
standalone via the built-in `nvim --server` notification bridge.

| Plugin | Integration | Issue |
|---|---|---|
| `nvim-notify` / `vim-notify` | Route vim notifications through nvim-notify for styled popups | TBD |
| `vim-airline` | Expose a status segment function for airline's right section | TBD |
| `lualine.nvim` | Provide a lualine component for claude state + last-status dot | TBD |
| `heirline.nvim` | Provide a heirline component table for full customisation | TBD |

When implementing an integration, add it as an optional `require()` in
`lua/claude-status/init.lua` with a graceful fallback if the plugin is absent.

## Architecture

- **Hook dispatcher pattern** — a single entry-point script reads `hook_event_name` from
  stdin JSON and calls the appropriate handler function. Extra positional args are
  forwarded as chained scripts.
- **State files in /tmp** — each Claude session writes a JSON state file at
  `/tmp/claude-status-SESSION_ID.json`. The statusline reads this file.
  Writing is atomic (write to `.tmp`, then `mv`).
- **Config merge strategy** — `scripts/lib/config.sh` reads `config.json` (repo
  defaults), then deep-merges `~/.config/claude-status/config.json` (user overrides)
  using `jq * reduce`. User values win at every key.
- **Nvim remote-expr bridge** — `scripts/lib/notify.sh` discovers the Neovim server
  socket for the owning session and calls `nvim --server $socket --remote-expr` to post
  messages without a persistent daemon.
- **Winbar timer** — the Lua plugin uses `vim.loop.new_timer()` to drive the Neovim
  display refresh loop independently of hook events.
- **Config precedence** — settings resolution order (highest wins): 1)
  `vim.g.claude_status_*` variables (Neovim-only); 2)
  `~/.config/claude-status/config.json` (user overrides); 3) `config.json` in repo
  (shipped defaults).

## Config System

| File | Role |
|---|---|
| `config.json` (repo) | Shipped defaults; do not edit for personal preferences |
| `~/.config/claude-status/config.json` | User overrides; never overwritten by install/update |

The merge is performed with `jq`. Nested objects are merged one level deep; scalars and
arrays are replaced by the user value.

## State Files

Each running Claude session produces `/tmp/claude-status-SESSION_ID.json`:

```json
{
  "session_id": "abc123",
  "state": "working",
  "directory": "/home/user/project",
  "branch": "feat/3-watcher-health",
  "git_staged": 2,
  "git_modified": 1,
  "context_tokens": 14200,
  "cost_usd": 0.042,
  "prompt_start_epoch": 1700000000,
  "duration_seconds": 12
}
```

Fields are updated by hook events. The statusline script reads this file and formats it
for display.

## Testing

```sh
# Status bar unit tests
bash tests/test-statusline.sh

# List available mock events
bash tests/mock-event.sh --list

# Fire a specific mock event
bash tests/mock-event.sh Stop

# Headless Neovim plugin tests
nvim --headless -l tests/test-vim.lua
```

Tests are in the `tests/` directory. Mock events are JSON payloads that replicate what
Claude would send via stdin to the hook dispatcher. Headless Neovim tests load the
plugin and exercise the Lua API without a GUI.

## Skills

| Skill | Command | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| add-issue | `/add-issue` | Create a new GitHub issue with labels |
| issues | `/issues` | List open issues grouped by component |
| commit | `/commit` | Stage and commit with proper message format |
| pr | `/pr` | Create a PR with correct naming, labels, and issue reference |
| changelog | `/changelog` | Update CHANGELOG.md from commits and issues |
| test | `/test` | Run the test suite and report results |

## Adding New Features

1. Create a GitHub issue with `/add-issue` — note the issue number N
2. Create a branch: `git checkout -b feat/N-short-desc`
3. Implement the feature, writing tests alongside the code
4. Run `bash tests/test-statusline.sh` and `nvim --headless -l tests/test-vim.lua`
5. Update `CHANGELOG.md` with `/changelog`
6. Commit with `/commit` — include `closes #N` in the message
7. Open a PR with `/pr` — body must contain "Closes #N"; add label `minor` if appropriate
8. Merge the PR; the version bumps automatically per the versioning rules above
